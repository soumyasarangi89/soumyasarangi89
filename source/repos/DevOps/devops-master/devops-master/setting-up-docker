$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
$ sudo yum-config-manager \

    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
$ sudo yum install docker-ce
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl status docker

sudo usermod ec2-user -G docker

## At this stage if you run commands like $docker images
## it wont work. To achieve that
$ sudo usermod ec2-user -G docker
$ exit 
re-login
Now:
$ docker images 
it will work but no image yet.

## To check whether it has worked correctly 
$sudo docker run hello-world
It shall give following output:

"""
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
