## Study materials for DevOps practices.

### DevOps Roadmap
  
  1. Learn any of cloud provider and do small projects on services provided by cloud provider. You can go for certification if you feel confident on that        cloud. It could be AWS, Microsoft Azure or GCP( Google Cloud Platform).
  
  2. Try to learn any of configuration management tool such as Ansible or Chef. Though Ansible has good learning curve and it's configuration quite readble      for even beginners. You can go for Ansible.
  
  3. Learn and practice Linux OS. Do troubleshooting in Linux and write Bash scripts to automate manual tasks. Since Most of the server actually                provisioned are Linux in production.
 
  4. Docker and Kubernetes. Docker is phenomenal in devops practice and software development cycle. Kubernetes is used to manage docker containers. I'll        put study material for the same.

  5. Infrastructure provisioning through IaC ( Infrastructure as code) tools such as Terraform. Terraform is mostly used in industry.
