# Bash self-check questions:

1. From which directory will `cd ..` not move to the parent directory?

2. Are the paths `~/lab_1` and `~/lab_2` relative or
    absolute?

3. What are the two ways in which we could inspect the contents of the `/` directory
    from your own home directory.

4. What is the difference in behaviour of `ls`
    when run with the `-1` (digit) and `-l` (letter) options? How does
    `ls -1` differ from `ls` without options?

5. If you want to hide the group names in the long listing format,
    which extra options would you need to set when searching within the home
    directory?

6. Try accessing the documentation for the command `man` all the ways
    you can think of. Was there a difference in the output depending on
    how we asked to view the documentation? Could you access the
    documentation for the `ls` command all three ways?
