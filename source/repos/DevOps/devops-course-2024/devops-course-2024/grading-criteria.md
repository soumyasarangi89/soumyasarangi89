# Grading Criteria of the KTH Devops Course

- we are all aware that assessment may be subjective in nature. In case of disagreement, the informed judgment of the Professor is the final decision.
- in the grading criteria presented below, the mandatory parts do not count as "yes" for grading.
- Presentation and demos are mandatory.
- In case of a task failure, the students receive instructions for repetition through Canvas
